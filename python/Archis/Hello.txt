The Eurasian crag martin (Ptyonoprogne rupestris) is a small swallow with brown upperparts, paler underparts, and a white-spotted square tail.
It breeds in mountains in southern Eurasia and northwestern Africa.
It is larger and has brighter tail spots than the three other species in its genus.
 Many European birds are resident, but northern and Asian populations winter in north Africa, the Middle East or India.
 This martin builds a half-cup mud nest lined with soft material under a cliff overhang or on a building, and the female lays two to five brown-blotched white eggs, incubated mainly by her although both parents feed the chicks.
 The martin feeds on insects that are caught as it flies near cliff faces or over open country.
 Adults and young may be hunted by birds of prey or corvids, and may host blood-sucking mites.
 With its large and expanding range and population there are no significant conservation concerns.
